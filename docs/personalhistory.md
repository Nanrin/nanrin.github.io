# Personal History

# Early exposure

I first meditated in Tae Kwan Do classes which I took from the age of 7 until sometime in high school. I sometimes did it at home, although only on rare occasions for short periods of time. In college I was introduced to hatha yoga and did some meditation as a part of that as well.

Starting in 2011, I began to casually study Theravada Buddhism before going to Thailand. I occasionally meditated, visited wats, talked to monks and lay people. Towards the end of 2014 I read a dhamma book on the four noble truths, the eight-fold path, and other core teachings of Buddhism. The clear picture of key Buddhist teachings along with definitions to dozens of Pali terms really sparked my interest in Dhamma. Still, I wasn't Buddhist and refused to participate in any sort of ceremony or ritual.

## 2015
I picked up a dozen books from well known monks (particularly Buddhadasa) and started meditating, this time with more purpose. Still, mediation practice was infrequent and didn't go very far. I enjoyed the calming break from everyday life, but I was mostly engaged in mind-wandering.

## 2016
I kept studying books and started listening to dhamma talks daily. I began to use several different manuals for meditation. I sat for 5-15 min each day. I tried out many practices for the first time - mindfulness of death, metta, and walking meditation. I began to see the value in chanting and some ritual.

I began to be involved in communities - I regularly went to the local wat, talked to monks, became friends with fellow mediators, and went on weekend retreats. I also joined in the online western Buddhist world, having previously only referred to Thai books and monks.

## 2017

I was sitting about 30 minutes daily, along with chanting and other practices. I moved to my current city and became involved with several Dhammayut temples. I participated in a meditation teacher course but dropped out towards the end in favorof spent most of my weekends at a forest temple (I had no interest in the certificate). At the end of the year I went on a week long self-lead retreat at a forest temple.

## 2018 

During this year I prepared to ordain as a monk, but due to illness (a unidentified viral infection that lasted for months, kidney stones, and gallbladder problems) was unable to ordain. I stopped attending temples in person while sick (and gave up on skipping dinner as fasting irritated my gallbladder to the point I couldn't function). 

During my sick period, I read the Diamond Sutra. I had a "flash of insight" while reading it and became very interested in Zen. As there aren't any zen temples in Thailand, I joined Treeleaf Zendo online. It took a little while to get used to Mahayana Buddhism, but after accepting that Zen Buddhist teachings could be just as good as early Buddhist teachings, I was hooked and prepared for Jukai (receiving the precepts).

As a result of studying the Pali teachings with Dhammarato I came to have firm faith in the teachings and doubt was reduced considerably. This conviction has persisted ever since.

## 2019

In January I took Jukai with Jundo Cohen and received the Dharma name of Nanrin (Southern Forest).  

In February I went on my first formal group retreat at [Dipabhavan](Dipabhavan.org) thanks to a generous supporter. I absolutely loved the retreat - having a center to provide basic facilities (food, water, place to stay, toilets), teachings, and retreat structure made it very easy to practice.

After getting home I was very busy with work. I was also finally able to access some money I had saved in America (my accounts had been frozen for quite some time), and used it to purchase land outside of town, build a small (2x3m) bamboo hut, and get access to power and water via solar cells and a borehole well. 

During the rainy season I sewed a kesa under the guidance of Treeleaf Sangha.

In December I built a larger structure (5x5m) with two small rooms and a portch along with a bathroom.

## 2020

I moved into a larger structure (5x5m) which also accomodates my wife and step-daughter. I started working on a translation of Buddhadasa's work on Anapanasati.

I currently have a good environment for practice at home. My home is moderatly secluded, and usually work from home. I have access to basic conveniences - but I deliberately limit them to avoid excess. For instance, I have running water and a toilet, but no clothes washer; protection from elements, but no heating or cooling beyond a fan and clothing; protection from insects and animals, but only in the mosquito net. These sorts of things provide exposure to nature, requires little money, and is less damaging on the environment. 

I don't have much money, and very little income, but I do have enough to buy food and basic supplies. The lack of financial stability keeps me on my toes.
