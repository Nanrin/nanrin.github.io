# Personal History

# Early exposure

I first meditated in Tae Kwan Do classes which I took from the age of 7 until sometime in high school. I sometimes did it at home, although only on rare occasions for short periods of time. In college I was introduced to hatha yoga and did some meditation as a part of that as well.

Starting in 2011, I began to casually study Theravada Buddhism before going to Thailand. I occasionally meditated, visited wats, talked to monks and lay people. Towards the end of 2014 I read a dhamma book on the four noble truths, the eight-fold path, and other core teachings of Buddhism. The clear picture of key Buddhist teachings along with definitions to dozens of Pali terms really sparked my interest in Dhamma. Still, I wasn't Buddhist and refused to participate in any sort of ceremony or ritual.

## 2015
I picked up a dozen books from well known monks and started meditating, this time with more purpose. Still, mediation practice was infrequent and didn't go very far. I enjoyed the calming break from everyday life, but I was mostly engaged in mind-wandering.

## 2016
I kept studying books and started listening to dhamma talks daily. I began to use several different manuals for meditation. I sat for 5-15 min each day. I tried out many practices for the first time - mindfulness of death, metta, and walking meditation. I began to see the value in chanting and some ritual.

I began to be involved in communities - I regularly went to the local wat, talked to monks, became friends with fellow mediators, and went on weekend retreats. I also joined in the online Buddhist world, having previously only referred to Thai books and monks.

## 2017

I was sitting about 30 minutes daily, along with chanting and other practices. I moved to my current city and became involved with several Dhammayut temples. At the end of the year I went on a self-lead retreat at a forest temple.

## 2018 

During this year I prepared to ordain as a monk, but due to illness (a unidentified viral infection that lasted for months, kidney stones, and gallbladder problems) was unable to ordain. I stopped attending temples in person while sick (and gave up on skipping dinner as fasting irritated my gallbladder to the point I couldn't function). 

During my sick period, I read the Diamond Sutra. I had a "flash of insight" while reading it and became very interested in Zen. As there aren't any zen temples in Thailand, I joined Treeleaf Zendo online. It took a little while to get used to Mahayana Buddhism, but after accepting that Mahayana Buddhist teachings could be just as good as early Buddhist teachings, I was hooked and prepared for Jukai (receiving the precepts).

## 2019

In February I went on my first formal group retreat at [Dipabhavan](Dipabhavan.org) thanks to a generous supporter. I absolutely loved the retreat - having a center to provide basic facilities (food, water, place to stay, toilets), teachings, and structure made it very easy to practice.

After getting home I was very busy with work. I was also finally able to access some money I had saved in America, and used it to purchase land outside of town, build a small (2x3m) bamboo hut, and get access to power and water via solar cells and a borehole well.

I currently have a good environment for lay practice. My home is moderatly secluded, and when I do have work, it can usually be done at home. I have access to basic comforts - running water (but no toilet, shower, or clothes washer), electricity (used for a light bulb, a fan, kettle, and charging my cell phone and laptop), protection from elements (but no heating or cooling beyond a fan),  protection from insects and animals (but only in the mosquito net). I have hand tools to do most maintainance, along with an electric drill and petrol brush cutter for a few tasks that require them. I don't have much money, and very little income, but just enough to buy food and basic supplies. The lack of financial stability keeps me on my toes, and from time to time, drives me crazy with worry.
