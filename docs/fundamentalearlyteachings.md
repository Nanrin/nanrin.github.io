# Introduction

This is based of this document is the excellent book by Choong Mun-keat (Wei-keat), "The Fundamental Teachings of Early Buddhism." Said title was written by a very well educated Taiwanese monk who has studied in Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Australia, earning a number of degrees. The author compares the Pali Samyutta Nikaya (SN) with the Chinese Samyukta Agama (SA). In the process he highlights the key ways each topic is talked about, and how the two compare or differ. On the whole, the organization and content of the two works is remarkably similar.

To facilitate studying fundamental early Buddhist teachings, I am using this book to collect up sutra references, primarily from SA. Suttas from SN will be included where they present something not present in SA (or not as succinctly stated, or when the SA counterpart to the SN sutta is not available in English translation).
