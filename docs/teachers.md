# Teachers

I got started by reading books and asking people here in Thailand about Buddhism. Eventually I went to a wat with the intention of studying and practicing. Since then I have moved several times and thus changed who I meet in person. I currently have two main teachers, both of whom I talk to via skype.

* [Dhammarato](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjxg5GJFsRqnS-YLTzyrjLQ) (Since April 2018). Currently a layman, he was a monk with [Bhikkhu Buddhadasa](https://www.bia.or.th) for many years before disrobing to help his aging mother. We have lively chats quite often.

* [Jundo Cohen](treeleaf.org) (Since May 2018) I don't talk to Jundo personally very often, but I am a fairly active member of Treeleaf Sangha. Jundo bestowed the name Nanrin on me when I received jukai (Boddhisattva precepts) from him.

* [Bhikkhu Buddhadasa](https://www.bia.or.th) was Dhammarato's teacher. His book Handbook for Mankind converted me to Buddhism, and I have read many of his books since. As I've had the chance to stay at [Dipabhavan](https://www.dipabhavan.org/) and practice with [Ajahn Po](https://th.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%93_(%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B4%E0%B9%8C_%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%BA%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%AA%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A3)), and work with [Tan Dhammavidu](http://dhammavidu.com/DV/Tan_Dhammavidu.html) on translating some of Bhikkhu Buddhadasa's work, I feel he is my teacher although we never have met in person.
