# Politics, News, and Social Media

I do not read any news sites regularly. I don't buy into the idea that one needs to be informed by reading or watching the news. I do know about major events - people tend to talk about things. If I do get curious about something I can read up about it specifically. Almost all news's impact on day to day life is from the agitation it causes. This agitation takes many forms such as discontent, concern, fear, indignation, rage. The agitation it causes is hardly worth the small benefit gained from knowing about whatever is being talked about. Same goes for most social media. It may seem harmless, but it subtly skews our views of other people. I wouldn't go so far as to say that news and social media must be completely avoided. It can be useful in very limited amounts, but one must be careful to avoid the many downsides.

News sections sound an awful lot like a modern version of the following list:

> talking about kings, robbers, ministers of state; armies, alarms, and battles; food and drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, and scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women and heroes; the gossip of the street and the well...

> [DN 2](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/DN/DN02.html) (tr. Thanissaro Bhikkhu)

This list can be found in several places in the Pali. The first place is in the first sutta in the canon - the Brahmajala Sutta. It's a part of a section of the sutta talking about the Tathagata's virtue as seen by everyday people. The same list is in the next sutta, the Samaññaphala sutta (the fruit of the contemplative life) in a section about the visible fruits seen in people who leave home to follow the Buddha. This is a stock list of lowly topics of conversation, the same list is used in many other suttas. They are said to be addicting topics of conversation that renunciates should avoid. Not talking about these sorts of things is one of the more obvious ways that renuciation and the path is manifest.

In the greater discourse on emptiness, the Buddha recommended that 

> “If, while he is dwelling by means of this dwelling [emptiness], his mind inclines to speaking, he resolves that ‘I will not engage in talk that is base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unbeneficial, that does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calm, direct knowledge, self-awakening, or unbinding—i.e., talk about kings, robbers, & ministers of state; armies, alarms, & battles; food & drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, & scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women & heroes; the gossip of the street & the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world & of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not.’ In this way he is alert there.

> “‘But,’ (he resolves,) ‘I will engage in talk that is scrupulous, conducive to awareness-release, and leads exclusively to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calm, direct knowledge, self-awakening, & unbinding—i.e., talk on modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, arousing persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and the knowledge & vision of release.’ In this way he is alert there.

> [MN 122](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN122.html) - the greater discourse on emptiness, compre with [AN 10.70](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_70.html) and [AN 10.69](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_69.html)

As a householder, it's inevitable that one must talk about some of thise things from time to time. But making these things an enshrined part of one's day is a bad idea. It's bad enough that they intrude on a regular basis without seeking them out. The suggested alternatives - modesty, contentment, seclusion, non-entanglement, persistence, virtue, concentration, discernment, release, and knowledge and vision - are a much more praiseworthy topics of conversation.

Politics is a messy, dirty game. I want a better world. I think everyone does. I like a lot of what gets talked about on the left - there are things that need changing. I also like what gets talked about on the right - there are things that shouldn't change. Mostly, I want a moderately stable society to live in. Living in a world free of prejudice and discrimination, where everyone has the necessities of life would be great! But quick changes destabilize society and can lead to backlash and disfunctional cycles. Similarly, sticking with the way things were in the past usually involves ignoring (or covering up) the bad things in the past. Getting involved in it all is a surefire way to stay attached to views and let desire reign. That's the path to suffering.

A lot of modern political discourse is intended to cause panic and hatred.

Sensuality, ill-will, and harm

The Samaññaphala Sutta - the fruits of the contemplative life - is a great text. I've looked to it as an example of what a good monk looks like, and what to strive towards myself. (A nice introduction to this long sutta [avaiable here](https://sacred-texts.com/bud/dob/dob-02in.htm).) In it it talks about all of the


dispassion
unfettered
shedding
modesty
* contentment
* reclusiveness
* persistence
unburdonsome


> the pleasure of renunciation, the pleasure of seclusion, the pleasure of peace, the pleasure of self-awakening
